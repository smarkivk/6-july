ArrayList<?> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add("Hello"); // Adding a String object
myList.add(42); // Adding an Integer object
myList.add(true); // Adding a Boolean object

Object element = myList.get(0); // Retrieving an element as Object type
System.out.println(element); // Output: Hello

//The ? denotes an unknown type that can be any class or interface.
It is useful when you want to create a collection that can hold objects of different types.
You can add elements to the ArrayList using the add() method, but you can only retrieve elements as Object type.
Since the type is unknown, you cannot invoke methods specific to the type of elements in the ArrayList.
It provides flexibility when you don't need to perform specific operations on the elements, but you want a general-purpose collection.
